        <h2> Favorite Dish </h2>
        <text>
            the reason I like steak so much is because of my personal history with the food and 
            my ongoing quest to become an ok cook, I really like having the ability to cook in 
            my back pocket but steaks despite being so simple provide a certain flavor profile
             and require a very specific set of skills that I intend to hone for a long time. 
             Medium Rare is my <b> favorite </b> temperature of steak because it's the 
             <b>perfect</b> done-ness that gives a nice amount of chew while also being juicy 
             and without the grossness of a rare or blue steak.
