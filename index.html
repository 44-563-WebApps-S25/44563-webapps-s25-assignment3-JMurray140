        <text>
            the reason I like steak so much is because of my personal history with the food and my ongoing quest to become an ok cook, I really like having the ability to cook in my back pocket but steaks despite being so simple provide a certain flavor profile and require a very specific set of skills that I intend to hone for a long time. Medium Rare is my <b> favorite </b> temperature of steak because it's the <b>perfect</b> done-ness that gives a nice amount of chew while also being juicy and without the grossness of a rare or blue steak.
