        known in the day time as Jeremy Murray and Jason Trenton in the day
        Jade Magnolia and Jason are Super Heroes based in St. Louis Missouri who fight crime
        dressed in Jade with Gold Accents they fly throughout the city fighting crime 
        the Jade covering most of the suit with the shining Jade Green covering most of his suit representing the plants that
        he grows, the gold showing that justice will always come First
    </p>
    <p>
        the Jade is broken by the gold stripes that travel the sides of the suit with no mask because the Jade Magnolia doesn't
        fear his enemies his emblem is a gold world tree in the center of his chest signifying his attachment to saving not just STL
        but the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jason is my trusty side-kick dressed in light blue costume with a black mask and black accents throughout
        he found him around the streets trying to fight crime as a delinquent. Jeremy took in the young boy to teach him how to
        really fight crime as a hero and not just a vigilante
        While Jeremy doesn't fear the enemy, Jason is just a teenager and his duties come secondary to being a teenager.
        the enemy can't be too far behind him or else he risks being stuck in the hero life forever. As Jeremy knows far too well.

        Jade Magnolia uses his powers of
        <ul>
            <li> Green Laser Blasts </li>
            <li> Flight </li>
            <li> Plant Growth </li>
        </ul>
        to fight crime using the powers to bring justice to STL by growing the trees to entangle
        his enemies and entangle them leaving them for the police to grab them
        <br>
        Jason uses his powers of
        <ul>
            <li> Ice </li>
        </ul>
        to speed throughout the city to quickly find crime or subdue them long enough for the Jade Magnolia to finally find him, only
        working as a Hero when he's not at school or otherwise working on being a normal teenager.
