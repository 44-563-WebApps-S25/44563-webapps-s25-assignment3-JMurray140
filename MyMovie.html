    <text>
        My favorite movie of all time is probably Avengers Infinity War. is it a perfect movie?
         no it has flaws for sure, the pacing, some of the character decisions.it isn't the 
         best movie ever made objectively speaking from a directing and filmic perspectives but
          it's my favorite movie because of what it represents the culmination of years of 
          build up and foreshadowing that goes back far longer than any 1 movie could possible 
          give for context.
